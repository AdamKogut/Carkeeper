# Carminder

A webapp created to keep track of a user's car service history. It supports multiple cars and as many services as needed. The app also has notifications so the day before a service comes due it notifies the user through email or text but only if they opt in to the service.

The frontend was written in javascript using the React framework with the elements being mostly from material-ui. The server is written in javascript using nodejs and expressjs. And finally the database is a javascript wrapper around firebase. The app was also hosted on firebase with a shortened link down below.
